# Dynamic-Programming-Algorithms-for-Sequence-Alignment
This repository provides R scripts for performing **Global** and **Local Sequence Alignment**. The scripts allow users to input custom sequences, alignment type, and scoring parameters, while providing default values for convenience.

## Features
- Supports **Global** and **Local Alignment**.
- Allows user-defined sequences and alignment scoring parameters.
- Default values for match score, mismatch score, gap penalty, and sequences.
- Provides detailed score and traceback matrices for better understanding of the alignment process.

## Prerequisites
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- No additional packages are required.

## Usage
Run **script.R** after providing the sequences, algorithm choice, and scores for match, mismatch, and gap. Default values of each parameter are provided for convenience.
